## ShopList

### Overview
ShopList is a simple React-based application that allows users to create and manage a shopping list. Users can add items they want to purchase from the store and delete items once they're no longer needed. The project is designed to enhance your productivity while shopping by keeping track of the items you need in one place.

### Features
- **Add new items** to the shopping list.
- **Display the complete list** of items.
- **Delete items** from the shopping list.
- **Interactive user interface** built with React.

### My Work on ShopList
As the developer of ShopList, I have been focusing on building the frontend of the application. Below are the key aspects of my contributions:

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface using React, CSS, and Bootstrap.
   - Developed reusable components such as input fields, buttons, and list items for better modularity and maintainability.

2. **State Management**:
   - Used React's `useState` hook to dynamically manage the list of items.

3. **Interactivity**:
   - Added functionality to allow users to add new items to the list by capturing their input and rendering it dynamically.
   - Implemented a delete feature to enable users to remove specific items from the list.

4. **Current Status**:
   - The project is a **work in progress** and focuses on the frontend implementation.
   - Backend functionality or data persistence has not been integrated yet, as this is currently a frontend-only project.

5. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Planning to add localStorage integration to allow users to save their lists persistently.
   - Exploring the addition of search functionality and drag-and-drop features for better usability.
